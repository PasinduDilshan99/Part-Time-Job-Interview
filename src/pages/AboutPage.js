            Part-time jobs are great ways to gain professional experience and
            earn a steady income while also working fewer hours. While these
            jobs may not require the same amount of experience as some full-time
            positions, employers still require candidates to submit polished and
            cohesive resumes with their applications. If you're seeking a
            part-time job, you may benefit from learning how to draft a resume
            that impresses any hiring manager. In this article, we discuss the
            type of content you may include in this document, how to write a
            part-time job resume and a template and example you may use as a
            reference.
